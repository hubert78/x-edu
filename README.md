#  [X Scrapping App For College Application](https://x-edu-app.streamlit.app/)

### OVERVIEW
This is a streamlit web application to help myself and friends gather, analyze, and quickly access important college application information found on X (formerly Twitter). 

### THE PROBLEM
Twitter, in its current form, provides users the ability to bookmark a tweet they find interesting and be able to access the said tweet under their bookmarks. However, with so much happening on Twitter, ones bookmarks can easily become cluttered, making it difficult to find a piece of relevant information. And so, this web application was created to make it easy to find tweets relevant to our college application process, and categorize these tweets into different sections such as 'Bioinformatics PhD', 'Biology PhD', 'Application Fee Waiver', etc. This tweet categorization is especially important so as to allow the user to quickly locate a relevant tweet. 

### METHODOLOGY
In the abundance of information of Twitter, simply making a Twitter search for information could be a time-consuming process. Although Twitter attempts to make this process easier by categorizing search results into the most popular and latest, this doesn't always mean a popular tweet is relevant to the user. To address this, I integrated ChatGPT to filter out the search results to only make available tweets that would be relevant to the user. This is a great time saver. 

### SIGNIFICANCE
Sharing information between friends can always be a daunting task, when one has to remember which friend shared what message with them, and on what platform was such a message shared. This web application is to help my friends and I be able to gather and share important Twitter information among ourselves from a single source.
